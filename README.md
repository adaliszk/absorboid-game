# Untitled Game Idea for 31th JameGam

The theme for this jam is "Four Colours" with the special object of "Sponge", the submission idea is to be decided at this point.

## Pre-requisites

- Git-LFS (https://git-lfs.github.com)
- Godot 4.1 (https://godotengine.org/download)
- Code editor (Godot, JetBrains, VSCode, etc.)

## Development

Make sure you have GIT-LFS installed and enabled before cloning the repository.
Once you clone, it should automatically download the large files and setup the
git hooks for it.

Once cloned, run `./setup.sh` to setup the project that will add hooks to update
the `git_version.txt` which is used to display the current version in the game.
